# Happy Birthday Website template (React.js/CSS)

[Happy Birthday Website](https://hbd-template.vercel.app/) was created to provide inspiration and guidance on how to celebrate someone's birthday, which is a significant occasion.

## Reasons why I have created it

While there are many examples on Google on creating a Birthday Card in HTML/CSS, I aimed to develop a more technically-oriented website where we can apply and enhance our daily learning. I hope this website proves helpful for generating ideas and solutions in various situations.

For example, there may be instances where you want to celebrate the birthdays of family members, friends, or your partner, but they are not there due to reasons like business trips or pursuing studies. In such cases, you can send a birthday card, create a birthday video, send messages, and even use FaceTime. However, if you've learned computer programming, it provides an opportunity to showcase your skills to the person!!

## Notes

I have included basic instructions below so that you can edit, add, and enhance the functionality of my demo site. The intention was to present one of the celebration ideas with a tech twist :) (If there are any bugs, I apologize for that, and please let me know!)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Deployment

That's great to hear that you've deployed the website using [Vercel](https://vercel.com), especially with a React.js template. As long as you've stuck to front-end technologies like React.js and haven't added any additional back-end languages or databases, the deployment should indeed work smoothly.

### To update

I've put random photos and logos for each section, so please feel free to replace them with your original images and icons! Additionally, you can make adjustments to any component to better suit your design preferences or to align with specific ideas you have in mind.
